<h1>DROP SHIP PURCHASE ORDERS USER'S MANUAL</h1>

  All of the options are available in the admin.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Tools-&gt;PO Edit subcontractors</strong><br />
    You can enter a list of subcontractors/dropshippers (SCs from now on) you work with (all their contact info, emails, phone, etc.)</li>
  <li><strong>Tools-&gt;PO Assign to products</strong><br />
    You can set a default SC for each product</li>
  <li><strong>Customers-&gt;Send/Resend POs</strong><br />
    Using admin you can send POs to SCs
    <ol>
      <li> For each order in Processing you will see a list of all ordered products along with customer info in a simple table. For any 1+ -&gt; all of such order items, you can send POs to their default SCs, or select another SC from a drop-down list (separate for each ordered item and customer). One of the SCs is called &quot;Own stock&quot; which means you commit to ship the item from your stock. Useful if you happen to do that. :)  Don't ever delete Own stock!</li>
      <li> For each product item selected, they will be grouped by customer into respective POs and emails will be sent to those SCs. Each PO would be dated and numbered. All the info for drop-shipping is in the email: what was ordered and where does it have to be shipped to.</li>
      <li>If you send a P.O. for several items from one order they will all be grouped into the same PO.</li>
      <li>You can add comments to the PO and the Packing List</li>
      <li>You can preview and edit emails, but ONLY when sending one P.O. at a time.  You can have several products on the P.O., but they must all be from one order and for one subcontractor (i.e. the conditions that create a new P.O.!)</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>Using confirm_track_sub.php: 
To allow SCs to set these numbers, do the following: 
<ol>
<li>In Admins-&gt;Admin Profiles, create a profile with a name like 
"Supplier" or "SC".  For this profile, only permit them to 
access Customers-&gt;Confirm Tracking for Suppliers. </li>
<li>In Admins-&gt;Admin Users, create an account for the SC, with 
the profile you created above (Supplier or SC).</li>
<li>In Tools-&gt;PO Edit Subcontractors, set their customer id.</li>
</ol>
</ol>

<h2> Suggested Code Customizations </h2>
<ol>
<li>If you do not wish your SCs to be able to see the widgets on the 
front page of your admin page, make the following change: 
In admin/index_dashboard.php, right under 
<pre>
&lt;!-- header_eof //--&gt;
</pre> 
add this code.  In this case, the Suppliers profile id is 6: 
<pre> 
&lt;?php  
// If your userid is in the suppliers table, you have no business here.
$supplier = false; 
if (!zen_is_superuser()) { 
   $recs = $db->Execute("SELECT admin_profile FROM " . TABLE_ADMIN. " WHERE admin_id = " . $_SESSION['admin_id']); 
   if ($recs-&gt;fields['admin_profile'] == 6) $supplier = true; 
}
if (!$supplier) { 
?&gt;
</pre>

Then at the bottom of the file, just close the brace. 
<pre>
&lt;?php } ?&gt;
</pre>

</li>
</ol>

<h2> Optional Code Customizations </h2>
<ol>
<li>When the PO is sent using Customers-&gt;Send/Resend Purchase Orders,
the order status is changed if it is the default value of 1 (New Order).
By default it is set to 2, but you may customize this value by setting 
<pre>
POST_SEND_ORDER_STATUS
</pre>
in the file 
<pre>
YOUR_ADMIN/includes/extra_configures/send_pos.php
</pre>
</li>
<li>When the PO has tracking information added by the Supplier, who 
runs the confirm_track_sub.php script, 
the order status is changed. 
By default it is set to 2 for a full ship and 3 for a partial ship, but you may customize this value by setting 
the values 
<pre>
POST_SET_PARTIAL_TRACKING_STATUS
POST_SET_FULL_TRACKING_STATUS
</pre>
in the file 
<pre>
YOUR_ADMIN/includes/extra_configures/send_pos.php
</pre>
</li>
<li>
By default, Send/Resend POs will only show orders where status != 3.
You can change this if you wish.  For example, if you wish to only see 
orders where status = 1 on this screen, modify 
<pre>
YOUR_ADMIN/includes/extra_configures/send_pos.php
</pre>
and change the PO_STATUS_FILTER setting to 
<pre>
define('PO_STATUS_FILTER', ' o.orders_status = 1 '); 
</pre>
</li>
</ol>

The email template used when Customers-&gt;Send/Resend Purchase Orders
is invoked is in three parts:
