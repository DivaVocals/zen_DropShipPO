<h1>DROP SHIP PURCHASE ORDERS USER'S MANUAL</h1>

  All of the options are available in the admin, of course.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Tools-&gt;PO Edit subcontractors</strong><br />
    You can enter a list of subcontractors/dropshippers (SCs from now on) you work with (all their contact info, emails, phone, etc.)</li>
  <li><strong>Tools-&gt;PO Assign to products</strong><br />
    You can set a default SC for each product</li>
  <li><strong>Customers-&gt;Send/Resend POs</strong><br />
    Using admin you can send POs to SCs
    <ol>
      <li> For each order in Processing you will see a list of all ordered products along with customer info in a simple table. For any 1+ -&gt; all of such order items, you can send POs to their default SCs, or select another SC from a drop-down list (separate for each ordered item and customer). One of the SCs is called &quot;Own stock&quot; which means you commit to ship the item from your stock. Useful if you happen to do that. :)  Don't ever delete Own stock!</li>
      <li> For each product item selected, they will be grouped by customer into respective POs and emails will be sent to those SCs. Each PO would be dated and numbered. All the info for drop-shipping is in the email: what was ordered and where does it have to be shipped to.</li>
      <li>If you send a P.O. for several items from one order they will all be grouped into the same PO.</li>
      <li>You can add comments to the PO and the Packing List</li>
      <li>You can preview and edit emails, but ONLY when sending one P.O. at a time.  You can have several products on the P.O., but they must all be from one order and for one subcontractor (i.e. the conditions that create a new P.O.!)</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>Using confirm_track_sub.php: 
To allow SCs to set these numbers, do the following: 
<ol>
<li>In Admins-&gt;Admin Profiles, create a profile with a name like 
"Supplier" or "SC".  For this profile, only permit them to 
access Customers-&gt;Confirm Tracking for SCs. </li>
<li>In Admins-&gt;Admin Users, create an account for the SC, with 
the profile you created above (Supplier or SC).</li>
<li>In Tools-&gt;PO Edit Subcontractors, set their customer id.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
