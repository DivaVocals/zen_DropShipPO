Drop Shipping Purchase Orders Module for Zen Cart v1.5.x

BIG HUGE CAVEAT!!
=================
(for those who did not read the official support thread for this module)

This module is IN NO WAY compatible with Zen Cart v1.5.2. Has everything to do with the diff between mysql and mysqli.. I haven't the FIRST CLUE how to fix it (or the time to put into it right now).. So if anyone wants to pick this up.. feel free.. 

This updated version is for Zen Cart v1.5.0 - v1.5.1. DON'T ask me about v1.3.9 support (none is forthcoming, but YOU are free to adapt/test/try to see if it will work for v1.3.x stores)
